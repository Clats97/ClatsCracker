# ClatsCracker
ClatsCracker 1.01 is a powerful Python-based password cracking tool designed to help security professionals, penetration testers, and researchers test and strengthen password security. Featuring support for multiple hashing algorithms, flexible attack methods, hash auto detection, real time metrics (ETA & APS), logging session details, graceful interruption handling and dynamic resource management, ClatsCracker provides a one-stop solution for evaluating password resilience under real-world conditions.

**Key Highlights:**

**Multi-Algorithm Support:** Crack MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA3-256, Scrypt, Bcrypt, and Argon2id hashes, all within a single tool.

**Flexible Attack Methods:** Choose between dictionary-based or brute-force attacks, enabling both quick tests against known password lists and exhaustive searches for complex passwords.

**User-Friendly Design:** A menu-driven interface, clear prompts, and real-time progress reporting make it accessible to users of all skill levels.

**Scalable Performance:** Adjust the number of threads (1 to 1000) to use your system's capabilities and optimize crack speed and efficiency. You can also choose from 3 presets, including low, medium and high use of computer resources.

**Ethical and Secure Usage:** Prominent disclaimers and best practices encourage responsible, lawful application for penetration testing, auditing, research, and forensic investigations.

**Intended Audience:** ClatsCracker 1.01 is ideal for cybersecurity experts, IT auditors, digital forensics teams, and authorized penetration testers who need a reliable, comprehensive password cracking tool. Whether youâ€™re verifying the strength of internal credentials, researching algorithm weaknesses, or recovering critical passwords, ClatsCracker 1.01 is designed to streamline and enhance your workflow.

Be sure to download and read the "README.pdf" file, so you understand how to use it properly.

**HIGH PERFORMANCE DICTIONARY / WORDLIST AVAILABLE:** Over the last few months, Clats has been working on a dictionary / word-list file that contains common passwords and passwords in dictionaries with crack rates above 60%, with duplicates removed, no syntax errors (this ensures the file doesn't stop the cracking or skip over a valid password) and a high success rate. In testing, the dictionary / word-list has a crack rate slightly below 76% under test conditions (100 - shot) and is therefore highly successful. More work is still in progress to provide more features and functions to ClatsCracker, as well as the dictionary / word-list file. Because the file is large (160 GB+), it cannot be uploaded to GitHub. There are approximately 19.5 billion passwords in the file. If you would like access to this file, please email **skyline92x@pm.me** and you will be given a single use, password protected link to download via MEGA Hosting. Due to bandwidth restrictions, access to the file will be limited, and people who were not given access the first time will be given access after 30 days when the bandwidth resets.

If anyone encounters errors using ClatsCracker 1.01, please submit an issue that details the problem, and provide a step by step outline on how to duplicate the error. If you can provide any log data, that would be helpful too. Issues will be dealt with expeditiously, and would likely be corrected within 72 hours and released to this repository after testing.

Enjoy!
