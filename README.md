# ClatsCracker
ClatsCracker is a powerful and capable Python-based password cracking tool designed to help security professionals, penetration testers, and researchers test and strengthen password security. ClatsCracker supports multiple hashing algorithms, flexible attack methods, hash auto detection, real-time metrics (ETA & APS), session details, graceful interruption handling and dynamic resource management. ClatsCracker offers a one-stop solution to assess password resilience under real-world conditions.

**Key Highlights:**

**Multi-Algorithm Support:** Crack MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA1_v2, SHA224, SHA256, SHA512, SHA3_224, SHA3_256, SHA3_384, SHA3_512, RIPEMD160, BLAKE2_224, CRC32, BCRYPT, ARGON2ID, and SCRYPT hashes, all within a single tool.

**Flexible attack methods:** Choose between dictionary-based or brute-force attacks that enable both quick tests against known password lists and exhaustive searches for complex passwords.

**User-Friendly Design:** A menu-driven interface, clear prompts and progress reports make it accessible to users of all skill levels.

**Scalable Performance:** Adjust the number of threads (1 to 1000) to use the capabilities of your system and optimize crack speed and efficiency. You can also choose between 3 presets, including low, medium and high use of computer resources.

**Ethical and Secure Usage:** Prominent disclaimers and best practices encourage responsible, lawful application for penetration testing, auditing, research, and forensic investigations.

**Target Audience:** ClatsCracker is ideal for cybersecurity experts, IT auditors, digital forensics teams and authorized penetration testers who need a reliable, comprehensive password cracking tool. Whether you check the strength of internal credentials, research algorithm weaknesses or recover critical passwords, ClatsCracker is designed to streamline and improve your workflow.

Be sure to download and read the "README.pdf" file, so you understand how to use it properly. Read the wiki, it contains helpful information regarding this tool.

**HIGH PERFORMANCE DICTIONARY / WORDLIST AVAILABLE:** In recent months, Clats has been working on a dictionary / word-list file that contains common passwords and passwords in dictionaries with crack rates of 60% or higher, with duplicates removed, no syntax errors, optimizations and a high success rate. The dictionary / word-list has a crack rate slightly below 76% under test conditions (100 - shot) and is therefore highly successful. More work is still underway to provide ClatsCracker with more features and functions, as well as the dictionary / word list file. As the file is large, it cannot be uploaded to GitHub. The file contains approximately 19.5 billion passwords. If you would like to access this file, please send an e-mail to **skyline92x@pm.me** and you will receive a single password-protected link to download via MEGA Hosting. Due to bandwidth restrictions, access to the file will be limited, and people who have not been given access for the first time will be given access after 30 days when bandwidth resets.

If anyone encounters errors using ClatsCracker, please submit an issue that details the problem, and provide a step by step outline on how to duplicate the error. If you can provide any log data, that would be helpful too. Issues will be resolved quickly, and would likely be corrected within 72 hours and released to this repository after testing.

Enjoy!
