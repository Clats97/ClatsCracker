## Security Policies for ClatsCracker

ClatsCracker is intended for security professionals and researchers
to test password strength, identify weaknesses, and enhance system security. To
maintain a secure environment and discourage malicious use, the following
policies apply:

1. **Authorized Use Only:** The tool should be used exclusively for legal
   and ethical purposes. It must be deployed only on systems or data for which
   You have explicit permission to analyze.  
   *Rationale:* Unauthorized use may violate local or international laws and 
   could expose sensitive information.

2. **User Accountability:** Users must comply with all applicable laws and 
   institutional policies. We do not condone illicit activities, such as 
   unauthorized password cracking, network intrusion, or data theft. Violators 
   may face legal consequences.

3. **Responsible Disclosure:** Any newly discovered vulnerabilities within ClatsCracker or its dependencies must be reported promptly (see 
   “Reporting a Vulnerability” below). Our team will triage and patch issues 
   based on severity, striving to minimize user risk.

4. **Regular Audits and Testing:** The code base undergoes periodic security 
   assessments and external audits. This helps maintain a high standard of 
   security and ensures compatibility with emerging password hashing 
   technologies and security best practices.

5. **Encryption and Storage Practices:** The tool itself does not store cracked 
   hashes or plaintext results in a manner accessible to third parties. Users 
   are responsible for ensuring that any output generated is handled securely, 
   following industry standards, such as encryption-at-rest and controlled 
   access.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please follow the following procedure to ensure there is a
timely and effective resolution:

1. **Contact Point:** Email skyline92x@pm.me. Please do not post details publicly.  
2. **Acknowledgement Window:** We typically acknowledge receipt within 48 hours, 
   providing a preliminary assessment and initial response.  
3. **Update Frequency:** Expect status updates every 7 days until the 
   vulnerability is resolved or a clear remediation plan is established.  
4. **Resolution Timeline:** Critical issues are prioritized and, where possible, 
   patched within 3 days. Less critical vulnerabilities may require additional 
   time, depending on complexity and potential user impact.
5. **Outcomes of Reporting:**  
   - **Accepted Vulnerabilities:** We will credit contributors (if desired) in 
     the release notes.  
   - **Declined Vulnerabilities:** If an issue is deemed out-of-scope, 
     previously addressed, or not reproducible, we will communicate the reasons 
     for this decision clearly.
